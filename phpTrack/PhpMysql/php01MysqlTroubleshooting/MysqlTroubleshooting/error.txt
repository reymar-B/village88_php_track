When password is incorrect: Failed to connect to MySQL: (1045) Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)

I,m using no password that's why this error comes out.

When database name is incorrect is incorrect: Failed to connect to MySQL: (1049) Unknown database 'xxxx'.

To solve this problem correct the data base name.

Failed to connect to MySQL: (2002) php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed: No such host is known.

This error comes out when you don't include the defined DB host name in your mysqli() function.
